# DeepSucc
 Open source codes and datasets for the DeepSucc algorithm

## Document description


The folder of data contains the original dataset and the code for processing the data

The folder of feature includes five subfolders, and each subfolder corresponds to the feature extraction method

The folder of classifier includes Six subfolders. Under the subfolder named by the feature are the LSTM-CNN model code, CNN-LSTM model code, LSTM code and CNN model code. The subfolder "Deepsucc-10folds" contains the code for the ten-fold cross-validation test of the DeepSucc model.

The fold of Test contains data files and code files that implement the training and testing of DeepSUcc using the new data set for comparison with other tools.
